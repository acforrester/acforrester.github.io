abstract: The assimilation and integration of immigrants and their children into American society is vital to the future success of the United States of America. Learning English and adopting American social values are important components of assimilation and integration into our society, but patriotism and confidence in American institutions are also critical. Despite the importance of this issue, there is relatively little research on how well immigrants and their children patriotically assimilate. Based on their responses to the General Social Survey, we found that immigrants and their children have levels of patriotism that are about the same as those of native‐​born Americans or that exceed them. Additionally, immigrants and their descendants have more trust in the three branches of American government than do native‐​born Americans. Immigrants bolster patriotism and national trust in American government institutions.
