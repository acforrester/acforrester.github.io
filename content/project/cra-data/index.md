The objective of this project is to convert the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) data from fixed-width form into accessible CSV's.  The CRA data are a widely used in the finance literature as a local measure of small business and small farm lending.  While the CRA disclosure data do not comprehensively cover small business or small farm lending, Greenstone, Mas, and Nguyen (2020) estimate that "CRA eligible banks accounted for approximately 86 percent of all loans under $1 million."
