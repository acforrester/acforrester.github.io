A few recent papers on banking rely on data acquired from the Small Business Administration (SBA), which provide a register of loans guaranteed by the SBA by county by year.  My objective is to clean up these data to include project state/county FIPS codes and ID's to match banks (`RSSD`, `CERT`, and, possibly, `HMDAID`'s).
